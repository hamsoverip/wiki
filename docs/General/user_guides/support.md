# Finding Help (Getting Support)

If you need help, never fear. We are here to help.

If you need help, here are some steps to take:

* Look through the Wiki first. Alot of common questions are already answered here.
* Next, if you don't find an answer in these pages, put in a ticket in the ticket system that you can get to from the [main website](https://hamsoverip.com). This allows us to track issues. This allows us to see what common issues are so that we can either put a fix in place, or generate a wiki article to help others in the future.
* Once you have a ticket in, someone may reach out for farther information, or to schedule time with you to connect on Discord to get more information or even walk you through your issue.
* You can ask for help in the [Discord Server](https://hamsoverip.github.io/General/user_guides/discord.md). Keep in mind though you will get alot of answers and it will not be a tracked issue.

The biggest key here is to make sure to put a ticket in so that issues and problems can be tracked easier.
