# Getting Started

Thank you for choosing Hams Over IP! We are happy to have you here! There are other Ham Radio VOIP Services out there, but we are glad you chose to get an extension with us.

One of the nice things about this system is it is a "Bring Your Own Device" kind of thing. We will give you your credentials and allow you to configure your phone yourself. We also allow up to 10 endpoints (different phones) on your account. Because we put the onus of phone configuration back on the user, you will need to be familiar with configuring your device.

So lets get started:

* First, you will need to enter a ticket in our ticketing system. Please go to [https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/) and create an account. 
* Once your account is created, you will get a verification email to the email address you used to signup with.

    * If you do not have the email within a few minutes, you will need to check your Spam or Junk folders, in case it got routed there by your email provider.

* Once you have verified your email, you will need to log into the Ticketing System and then request a new extension. Follow the prompts on the screen to do that.

    * After your request is in, it can take a bit before your line is provisioned. Please be patient.
    * Once your extension is provisioned, you will get sent an email with your credentials. 
    * When configuration screens ask for a user name, your user name is your extension number.
    * You can use whatever device you want, but you will need to know how to configure it. Also know that we can support alot of phones, but there are a few that we receommend to make helping the end user easier. However, by joining one of our [chat services](https://hamsoverip.github.io/wiki/General/user_guides/chat-services/), you may be able to find help on phones too.

* While waiting for your line to be provisioned, read through the rest of the Wiki here. There is alot of information in these pages that can help you configure a phone or use other aspects of the service.
* Make sure to join one of our [chat services](https://hamsoverip.github.io/wiki/General/user_guides/chat-services/) for additional help/conversation!
* Signup at the main website [https://hamsoverip.com](https://hamsoverip.com) for the phonebook and BLF Dashboards. This is a seperate account from the Ticketing System.

Finally, and most importantly, enjoy using ther service!
