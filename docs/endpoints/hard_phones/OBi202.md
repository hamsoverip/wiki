# Setting Up an OBi 202 Adapter with Hams over IP

I have an analog telephone adapter (ATA) that lets me connect POTS phones to VoIP services.  Here's how to get your ATA working with Hams over IP.

## Logging in to the Device

I already have another VoIP service configured, so I will be configuring what the device calls **Service Provider 2** (or sometimes "B").

OBiTALK devices can be configured online with [OBiNET](https://www.obitalk.com/obinet/pg/obhdev), but my directions will cover setting up the device manually, using its built-in Web server;  for example, `http://192.0.2.2`.

When using the built-in Web server, you will find that almost all advanced options are greyed out until you un-check that row's Default checkbox.

## Service Provider Profile Configuration

On the left-hand side, under **Service Providers**, click on **ITSP Profile B**.

Under the General section:

* Name: Hams over IP
* SignalingProtocol: SIP

SIP section:

* ProxyServer: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* ProxyServerPort: `5160`
* ProxyServerTransport: `UDP`
* OutboundProxy: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* OutboundProxyPort: `5160`
* RegisterExpires: `3600`
* X_SessionRefresh: unchecked
* X_LineSeizeSubscribeExpires: `30`

## Voice Service Configuration

Under the **Voice Services** heading, click on **SP2 Service**.

* Enable: checked
* X_RegisterEnable: checked
* X_UserAgentPort: `5081`
* AuthUserName: your extension
* AuthPassword: your password
* URI: (blank)
* X_EnforceRequestUserID: checked
* X_SRTP: `Use SRTP When Possible`

Under **CallerIDName**, enter your caller ID as you want other people to see it.  I used my full name and call sign.  I'm not sure if HoIP overrides this setting or not.

## That's it!

Finally, reboot the device and see if the extension will register.  Now, pick up whatever telephone you've plugged into your ATA and see if you get a dial tone!

(Yes, this 50-year-old phone actually works with HoIP!  The OBi ATA is under my desk and not pictured.)
