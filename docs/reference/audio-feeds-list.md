# Audio Feeds List

Here is a list of the audio feeds hosted from the HOIP network. This is a reference list for users to see what audio feeds are there, a description about them and who the contact person is in case there are questions or concerns.

To request an Audio Feed, please go to the [Helpdesk](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/) and sign in or create new account.  Then, open a New Ticket with the Help Topic of "Audio Feed Request" and complete the details as requested.

??? note "Audio Feed Owners/Admins: We need your help in keeping this list up to date"

    You have 2 options:

    1. Contribute to this page by doing a Pull Request in Github. Go to the [Contributing Guide](../wiki/contributing.md) to see how.
    2. Submit the following information via the [:fontawesome-brands-discord :#wiki-chat](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/975534734157443112) channel in Discord, in the following format:
        - Audio Feed extension number
        - Audio Feed name
        - Owner Contact Information (Please include Name, Callsign, HOIP Extension and email address)

??? warning "What to do if you spot that an Audio Feed isn't working"
    Audio Feeds are maintained by their owners and _not_ by Hams Over IP (even though a good number are owned by HOIP admins!), so you should reach out to the Owner to let them know as they may not already be aware.

    **The primary, and recommended way,** to do this is to @mention them in the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #audio-feeds :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/982388684575866950){ target="_blank" } on our Discord server.

    If you feel that you must contact the owner by phone, please be mindful of where in the world they are and therefore what time it might be.
